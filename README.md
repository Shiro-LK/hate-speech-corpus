# An Italian Twitter Corpus for Hate Speech Annotation

## Corpus description

This is a Twitter corpus built with the aim of representing and analysing hate speech against some minority groups in Italy, namely muslims, immigrants and Roma. 

The amount of annotated data currently consists of 1,828 tweets, thoroughly revised by expert annotators.

Similar to the one provided by [Wasseem and Hovy (2016)](https://github.com/ZeerakW/hatespeech), the corpus released here only contains the tweets' ID and their annotation. The content of each tweet can thus be retrieved using the Twitter APIs and querying the corresponding ID.
